# polymer-reference-app
Polymer reference application showcasing Circuit SDK Polymer Components

Steps to run:

 1. Clone this repo
 2. Install npm and bower if not already installed
 3. Run `bower install` to fetch the dependencies for this app
 4. Run a http server and open index.html

For an http server I suggest to get the npm module `http-server` with `npm install http-server -g` then start with the server with  `http-server -p 8081`
